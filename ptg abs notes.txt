#################################


I am not too familiar with PTG but from what I gathered in the papers, it has five factors: 1) new possibilities, 2) relating to others, 3) personal strength, 4) spiritual change, 5) appreciation of life; But I am not sure whether the composite score of the five dimensions is summed in practice to form a single measure? Is there a good paper from which I could learn more about how the framwork is derived? 

For effect size calculation, we usually use hedge's g, but it would require a single outcome variable. However, it is also possible to use multivariate meta-analysis taking into account multiple effect size measures, in our case, maybe 5 effect size measures reflecting each dimension in PTG. 

In addition, we could use random effects meta-regression to allow for heterogeneity among the studies in our analysis; I think we can consider including variables/moderators such as age, gender, social economic status, time points(some studies have 4 time points, some has 2 time points, and some has only 1 time point), country, forms of PTG.

Meta-analytic Plan Outline
Plan to report the main effects for each study type, then conducted moderator analysis using both a confirmatory and exploratory approach
Confirmatory
Retrospective
Pre-post: 2-cohorts 
Pre-post: 1-cohort
 Exploratory: stepwise regression
May only be feasible for the retrospective studies? - see if possible with the other types of study types


 we have three variables/moderators selected: 1) Year of publication, 2) age group, and 3) Language. We see a -0.12 standard deviation change if the reported effect sizes are from publications that comes out in 2020 compared to the publications that comes after 2020. In our case, we had years 2020, 2021, 2023. There is also a 0.35 standard deviation decrease in the normalized engagement measure if the subject is an adolescent as opposed to an undergraduate or graduate student. Language of instruction seems to be the most significant moderator that can explain the heterogeneity among studies, we found that students who engage with the courses through English tend to be less engaged than those who use a different language in their classroom setting. 
 
 \subsection{insert table 4 here}
Again, the estimates are standardized for the stepwise regression as well. According to the backward deletion procedure, we found that the year of publication, age group, and language was also included by the exploratory approach as significant predictors. The forward selection process also highlighted the age group as well as survey wording. 
Our exploratory approach, especially the backward deletion, provided an overview of how each moderator contributes to explaining the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies. This helps us to answer our third research question, that is did students who experienced a decrease in engagement differ based on the type of engagement? As we can see from Table 3, cognitive engagement had the greatest negative change compared to other engagement styles suggesting one of the main causes of the pandemic learning loss.

## meta analysis of observational studies in epidemiology
#####
# abstract
- public health and clinical practice and the explision of information in scientific literature 

- a proposal for reporting 

- so this is some kind of guideline 

- checklist was proposed 

- meta analysis of obserbational studies 

# intro
- so this is for readers, editors, reviewer rather than for the meta-analyst

- provide a tool for helping to understand and quantify sources of variability in results across studies 

- 27 participants get together and write up a guideline for meta analysis that's suited for readers that are less technical. 

- pooled analysis (what is it?)

- checklist/guideline 

# methods
- used 32 articles retrieved to generater the conference agenda and set topics of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity, study categorization, and statistical methods. 

- also circulated the checklist for comment to all conference attendees and representatives of several constituecies who would use the checklist

# results
- reporting background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusions (there is a table to show these elements in the paper)

- background: description of study outcomes, type of exposure or intervention used, complete descrription of the study population. heterogeneity of population, for ovservational studies, design, (case-conrtyol vs cohort stdies), and outcome (different studies tielding different relative risks that cannot be acounted for by sampling variation) is expected

- search: should include -- qualification of the searchers, specification of databases used, search strategyt and index term, any special features (explotion), search softrware used, use of hand search and contact with authors, use of materials in languages other than Englishb, use of unpubished material, and excluision criteria used. (the main thing highlighted here, i think is need of transparency in how the search process was conducted, and it gets a bit murky when we deal with datasets, and specific ins and outs of how the data based was acuqire and the operations associated with getting a cleaned data should be stated in the paper)


- methods: degree to which coding of data from the articles was specified and objsective, assessment of confounding, stuydy bquality and hetero geneity; use of statistical methods; and display of results (it does not say much about the degree of complexity for the methods)

- thus key compoents of design, rather than aggregate scores themselvesm amy be important; 

- it is recommanded that the reporting of quality scoring if it has been done and also recommend subgroup or sensitivity analysis rather than using quality score as weights in the analysis. (what exactly is sensitivity analysis?)

- in cases when heterogeinity of outcomes is particularlyb problematic, a single summary measure m,ay well be inappropriate. 

analysis that strratify by stduty feature or regression analysis withy designfeatures as predictors can be useful in assessing whether styudy outcomes indeed vary systematicaly witrh these features. 

- investigating heterogenity was a key feature of meta analysis of observational studies of some studies conerned with disease. 

- this section where it talks about latency (i dont get it) --  it could be taling about the latency of the disease. 

- results: use graphs, data visialization

- discussion: talk about bbias, possible association between endometrial cancer and oral contraceptives? but mainly, it seems that they want to address the issue of bias (publcation, or some design flaws in the original studies)

- conclusion: first, alternative explanation should be offered; second, appropriate generalization, third, future directions; fourth, talk about heterogeinity and the need to address it either by more systematic review or by original research; 


-- that table would be a concise summary of the whole paper

- the last page is essentially refernecedss 

- write down the table in the notes [done]

so understanding is that I should look at articles in the journals and see which journal is the right one 

so list 7 journals from either psychology or medical field
and figure out the effect size issue
I feel this is about 3-4 hours work, and I shall do it today, so that I can continue to work on my own projects in response time models;
